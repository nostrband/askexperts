# NIP-174 (0xAE) - Ask Experts

This NIP allows clients to discover subject matter experts, ask them questions privately and pay to get the answers.

We target a large set of experts (tens of thousands), and thus the process is performed in two steps:

1. **Ask/bid** step: client publishes the `ask` - an anonymised public summary of their question with some hashtags. Expert discovers an `ask` by hashtags and may reply with a `bid` - an encrypted offer advertising the expert's service and providing the `invoice` for a payment.
2. **Question/answer** step: client selects some `bids` (tens, maybe hundreds), pays each of them and sends encrypted `question` to each selected expert. Experts verify the payment and send an encrypted `answer`.   

The relays used for the ask/bid step are supposed to be *well-known* (discovered out-of-band). 

The relays for the question/answer step are *provided by each expert* in their `bids`.

## Ask/Bid Step

Client generates a `session key` and sends a public `ask` event with some hashtags to a well-known relay. Expert discovers the `ask` by hashtags, evaluates it and sends an encrypted `bid` with an offer and an `invoice`.

### Ask

Client MAY publish a `kind:20174` event (`ask`) with relevant `hashtags` and a short *summary of the question* to discover relevant experts.

Client SHOULD use a *random key* (`session key`) to hide their identity, and SHOULD NOT include any private or personally identifiable information in the `content`. 

Client SHOULD include *at least one hashtag*. 

Client SHOULD include a `max_bid_sats` tag to specify the amount of sats it is willing to pay.

`Ask` structure:
```js
{
  "id": <ask event id>,
  "kind": 20174,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <session pubkey>,
  "content": "Summary of the question is very brief",
  "tags":[
    ["t", "test"],
    ["max_bid_sats", "100"]
  ],
  "sig": <signature>
}
```

### Bid

Expert MAY subscribe to relevant hashtags to discover the `asks`. 

Expert MAY evaluate the content of the `ask` to decide whether it could provide a good answer. 

Expert MAY send an `kind:20175` event (`bid`) using a *random key* (`bid key`) and `e`-tagging the `ask` event id. The `content` of the `bid` is `bid payload` event of `kind:20176` signed by the `expert pubkey`, encrypted using nip44 for the `ask pubkey` with `bid privkey`. 

Expert SHOULD include an `offer text` in the content field of the `bid payload` to advertise themselves to the client, and `invoice` tag with the Lightning Network invoice for the payment. 

Expert SHOULD include one or more `relay` tags in their `bid payload` for the *question/answer* step.

Expert MAY use their real pubkey as the `expert pubkey` for `bid payload` to let clients take *expert's reputation* into account when evaluating the bid.

Expert SHOULD store at least the `bid payload` event id and corresponding client's `session pubkey` to be able to receive the `question` later.

`Bid` structure:
```js
{
  "id": <bid event id>,
  "kind": 20175,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <bid pubkey>,
  "content": nip44_encrypt(<session pubkey>, <bid privkey>, {
    "id": <bid payload event id>,
    "kind": 20176,
    "created_at": <timestamp>,
    "pubkey": <expert pubkey>,
    "content": "I will give a good answer because I'm awesome",
    "tags":[
      ["invoice", <lightning invoice>],
      ["relay", <relay url1>],
      ["relay", <relay url2>],
    ],
    "sig": <expert signature>
  }),
  "tags":[
    ["e", <ask_event.id>]
  ],
  "sig": <signature>
}
```

## Question/Answer Step

When client receives a set of `bids` from experts, it SHOULD decrypt them using it's `session privkey` and each bid's `bid pubkey`, evaluate their offers and choose some good ones. 

For each good `bid`, client SHOULD:
1. Make a payment for the `bid`.
2. Send encrypted `question` event.
3. Receive encrypted `answer` event.

### Bid Payment

To pay the expert, client SHOULD make an LN-payment using the provided `invoice` from the `bid payload` event. Client SHOULD save the `preimage` of the payment to include it in the `question` event next.

### Question

Client SHOULD send a `kind:20177` event (`question`) using a `random key` and `e`-tagging the `bid payload` event id. The `content` of the `question` is `question payload` structure, encrypted using nip44 for the `expert pubkey` from the `bid payload` with `session privkey`. 

Client SHOULD include the `preimage` tag in the `question payload` to prove the payment:

```js
{
  "id": <question event id>,
  "kind": 20177,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <random pubkey>,
  "content": nip44_encrypt(<expert pubkey>, <session privkey> {
    "content": "My full question with all the details and context",
    "tags":[
      ["preimage", <preimage>],
    ],
  }),
  "tags":[
    ["e", <bid payload event id>]
  ],
  "sig": <signature>
}
```

### Answer

Expert SHOULD receive the `question` events using the `bid payload` event ids that it issued lately.

Expert SHOULD find the stored `bid payload` and `session privkey` by `e` tag of the `question` event, decrypt the `question payload` using `expert privkey` and `session pubkey`, check that `preimage` matches the `payment_hash` of the invoice of the `bid payload` event, and check that the invoice is actually paid. 

Expert SHOULD send an `kind:20178` event (`answer`) using a *random key* and `e`-tagging the `question` event id. The `content` of the `answer` is the `answer payload` structure, encrypted using nip44 for the `session pubkey` using `expert privkey`.

```js
{
  "id": <answer event id>,
  "kind": 20178,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <random pubkey>,
  "content": nip44_encrypt(<session pubkey>, <expert privkey>, {
    "content": "My answer to your question",
    "tags":[
    ],
  }),
  "tags":[
    ["e", <question event id>]
  ],
  "sig": <signature>
}
```

## Expert Lists

Web of Trust approach is used to penalize bad experts and prioritize good ones.

Clients MAY put pubkeys of experts into `kind:10174` events (`expert lists`), along with a score in `0` (*blacklisted*) to `100` (*perfect*) range. 

Clients MAY fetch their own `expert list` events and lists of their friends to filter or prioritize the `bids` received from experts:

```js
{
  "id": <event id>,
  "kind": 10174,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <client pubkey>
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["p", <expert pubkey1>, "85"], // good expert
    ["p", <expert pubkey2>, "0"], // blacklisted expert
    ...
  ],
  "sig": <signature>
}
```
